==================================================
gnome-online-accounts 3.1.0
==================================================

gnome-online-accounts provides interfaces so applications and
libraries in GNOME can access the user's online accounts.

This release of gnome-online-accounts supports only Google
accounts. The target for GNOME 3.2 is to make e-d-s / Evolution use
this interface to discover mail, calendars and contacts.

Support for other providers (such as Yahoo and Facebook (for which GOA
support already exists but is turned off by default)) or other kinds
of services can be added later.
